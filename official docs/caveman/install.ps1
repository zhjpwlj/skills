# caveman — installer shim (Windows / PowerShell).
#
# Thin wrapper around bin/install.js (the unified Node installer). Every flag
# you'd pass to bin/install.js can be passed here; we just forward them.
#
# One-line install:
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/v2.6.0/install.ps1 | iex
#
# Local clone:
#   pwsh install.ps1 [flags]
#
# Why a Node installer? install.sh + install.ps1 used to be parallel sources of
# truth and constantly drifted (issue #249 was a `node -e "..."` quoting bug
# that silently dropped the JSON merge step on every Windows install). One
# Node script works everywhere without quoting bugs.
#
# Why no top-level param() and everything inside a function? `irm | iex`
# executes this file as a string: script-path variables ($PSCommandPath,
# $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path) are $null and a top-level param block cannot
# receive arguments through a pipe anyway (issue #565). Wrapping the logic in
# a function and forwarding $args keeps one script working for both the pipe
# path (no args, no script path) and the local-clone path.
