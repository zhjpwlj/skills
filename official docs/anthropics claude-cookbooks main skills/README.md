# Claude Skills Cookbook 🚀

A comprehensive guide to using Claude's Skills feature for document generation, data analysis, and business automation. This cookbook demonstrates how to leverage Claude's built-in skills for Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF creation, as well as how to build custom skills for specialized workflows.

> **🎯 See Skills in Action:** Check out **[Claude Creates Files](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files)** to see how these Skills power Claude's ability to create and edit documents directly in Claude.ai and the desktop app!

## What are Skills?

Skills are organized packages of instructions, executable code, and resources that give Claude specialized capabilities for specific tasks. Think of them as "expertise packages" that Claude can discover and load dynamically to:

- Create professional documents (Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Word)
- Perform complex data analysis and visualization
- Apply company-specific workflows and branding
- Automate business processes with domain expertise

## API Configuration

Skills require specific beta headers. The notebooks handle this automatically, but here's what's happening behind the scenes:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    default_headers={
        "anthropic-beta": "code-execution-2025-08-25,files-api-2025-04-14,skills-2025-10-02"
    }
)
```

**Required Beta Headers:**

- `code-execution-2025-08-25` - Enables code execution for Skills
- `files-api-2025-04-14` - Required for downloading generated files
- `skills-2025-10-02` - Enables Skills feature

## Working with Generated Files

When Skills create documents (Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, etc.), they return `file_id` attributes in the response. You must use the **Files API** to download these files.

### How It Works

1. **Skills create files** during code execution
2. **Response includes file_ids** for each created file
3. **Use Files API** to download the actual file content
4. **Save locally** or process as needed

### Example: Creating and Downloading an Excel File

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

# Step 1: Use a skill to create a file
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    container={
        "skills": [
            {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
        ]
    },
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}],
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create an Excel file with a simple budget spreadsheet"
    }]
)

# Step 2: Extract file_id from the response
file_id = None
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "tool_result" and hasattr(block, 'output'):
        # Look for file_id in the tool output
        if 'file_id' in str(block.output):
            file_id = extract_file_id(block.output)  # Parse the file_id
            break

# Step 3: Download the file using Files API
if file_id:
    file_content = client.beta.files.download(file_id=file_id)

    # Step 4: Save to disk
    with open("outputs/budget.xlsx", "wb") as f:
        f.write(file_content.read())

    print(f"✅ File downloaded: budget.xlsx")
```

### Files API Methods

```python
# Download file content (binary)
content = client.beta.files.download(file_id="file_abc123...")
with open("output.xlsx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(content.read())  # Use .read() not .content

# Get file metadata
info = client.beta.files.retrieve_metadata(file_id="file_abc123...")
print(f"Filename: {info.filename}, Size: {info.size_bytes} bytes")  # Use size_bytes not size

# List all files
files = client.beta.files.list()
for file in files.data:
    print(f"{file.filename} - {file.created_at}")

# Delete a file
client.beta.files.delete(file_id="file_abc123...")
```

**Important Notes:**

- Files are stored temporarily on Anthropic's servers
- Downloaded files should be saved to your local `outputs/` directory
- The Files API uses the same API key as the Messages API
- All notebooks include helper functions for file download
- **Files are overwritten by default** - rerunning cells will replace existing files (you'll see `[overwritten]` in the output)

See the [Files API documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/files-content) for complete details.

## Common Use Cases

### Financial Reporting

- Automated quarterly reports
- Budget variance analysis
- Investment performance dashboards

### Data Analysis

- Excel-based analytics with complex formulas
- Pivot table generation
- Statistical analysis and visualization

### Document Automation

- Branded presentation generation
- Report compilation from multiple sources
- Cross-format document conversion

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Progressive Disclosure**: Skills load in stages to minimize token usage
2. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple files in a single conversation
3. **Skill Composition**: Combine multiple skills for complex workflows
4. **Cache Reuse**: Use container IDs to reuse loaded skills

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Not Found**

```
ValueError: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found
```

→ Make sure you've copied `.env.example` to `.env` and added your key

**Skills Beta Header Missing**

```
Error: Skills feature requires beta header
```

→ Ensure you're using the correct beta headers as shown in the notebooks

**Token Limit Exceeded**

```
Error: Request exceeds token limit
```

→ Break large operations into smaller chunks or use progressive disclosure
